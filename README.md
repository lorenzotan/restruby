# README

This is a project I started to learn both Docker and Ruby on Rails.

These are the links I followed to help me build this Docker container and Rails app.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
